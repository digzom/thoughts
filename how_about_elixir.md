# I'm in love with Elixir

Last week I deployed my fist Phoenix application. It's almost 100% Elixir. No React, no
Angular, no Vue. All my javascript code is in one file and just for some configuration.

Don't get me wrong, I do like javascript. But writing an entire program, front and
backend with just one language, with smooth interactivity and a great UX, is awesome.

"Why don't you just use nodejs, then?"

Well, honestly? DX.

Using and installing different versions with ASDF was easy and setting up my database was
simple and intuitive. I added the authentication flow in 1 hour, with an intuitive way to
handle requests and almost no hidden tricks.

The Phoenix documentation was my best friend in the building process. Even when I asked
for help in the community channels (telegram, slack, twitter, discord), they pointed me
to the documentation and showed me something I had missed. That says a lot about the
documentation.

It's just a little step in that journey. I really want to work with Elixir someday. I
will continue studying NodeJS, React and all javascript ecosystem, but now I have a
another tool to build awesome things. :)
