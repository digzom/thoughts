## How to level up?
- Read the docs of your project. Setup, purpose, patterns. If it doesn't exist, help then righting a new one.
- When you are new in a project, it's hard to change things that you think it's wrong. First of all, work exactly with excellence in the current way. Once you earn their trust, try to suggest small changes.
- Work at a place you can make mistakes and make uncomfortable questions. With mistakes you can learn something new.
- Do know why you working in that feature? How this feature fits in the whole picture of the project? Ask this.
- Ask for help as soon as you realise that you're stuck.
- Do what nobody is doing.
- Improve your IDE. Master your editor according to your usage needs.
- Automate boring work. Automate what steals your productivity.
- Learn how to make honest and helpful feedbacks.
- Have ownership of your work. When you do your job well and work hard, you're investing in YOUR career. That's the major priority. Of course your company is profiting from your effort, but that's the way it works. That's why you're paid.
- Finish your tasks.
- Again: FINISH YOUR TASK. All the details. Double check your work. If there is no accepting criteria, make one while reading the task description.
