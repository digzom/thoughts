## The plan

Focus losing
-> I have to back with pomodoro.

Poor financial health 
-> Stop spending money!! Create a product and try to make money with it. Look for oportunities to make money.

Little time
-> I think that I already do what is possible to me

Have to be with Helena (because I want)
-> I think that I already do what I want to do

Procrastinanting
-> Maybe pomodoro and set short goals can help with it. Also, read some book about productivity.

Lack of clarity of what should I do
-> I think that this is a meta problem/solution. I'm doing all this to solve this problem.

Lack of courage
-> Must have financial healthy

Undiscipline
-> Pomodoro?

Hurry
-> Meditation

Lack of degree
-> Just keep going and do courses.

Inconsistency
-> Read books.

Lack of self confidence
-> Study a lot, talk with Pigor, do Exercism, do Learn how to learn course

Lack of knowledge in algorithms
-> Continue to doing the courses that you are doing

Lack of knowledge in Computer Science
-> Same

Lack of knowledge in Systems Design
-> Do the course that that girls talked about and read System Design Interview

Lack of knowledge in Software Architecture
-> Talk to Pigor and Carlos about your willing about work with that, read books about it

Lack of knowledge in financial aspect
-> Read books about it, follow people on twitter, watch videos about it

Lack of proactivity
-> Read books

Don't really like management
-> Well, I don't think that something can change this unless you really get into it to see if you don't really like.

Don't have money to have peace and make moves that would be a little bit more risky
-> Read books about it, follow people on twitter, watch videos about it
