# Mistakes

It is important to not do wrong things.

## Mistake 1 - Not solving a real problem for the users.

Talk to users.
Solution in search for problem:
    - Hmmm... IA is cool. How can I apply IA? *starts to search a problem that can be solved with IA*
Don't do this. You have to start form the problem.
If they don't care for the problem, they will not care for your solution.
You have to *fall in love* with a problem. A real problem.

## Mistake 2 - Getting stuck on a "tarpit idea" 

That are some ideias that have been coming up in the start up scenarios but it never gone anywhere.
Casuses:
    - Widespread problem that lots of potential founders encounter
    - Seems like it could be easily solvable with a startup
    - There's a structural reason why it's very hard or impossible to solve

You will just waste your life in this.
Example: it is always a hard time to decide what to do with your friends in the weekend, so you will come up with some ideia to solve this. Just don't. 

Google for your idea and if you can, talk with the founders to know if is going everything well. What is the hard part. Do a benchmark.

## Mistake 3 - Not evaluating an idea

Just jump on the first likely good idea without thinking about it.

## Mistake 4 - Waiting for the perfect idea

Be in the middle of these last two.

You should think of your idea as a **good starting point**.

# A framework - 10 Key Questions To Ask About Any Startup Idea

1. Do you have founder/market fit?
    - The most important criteria
    - Are you in the right team?
    - You and your team has what is necessary? (e.g.: we need a sales person and a tech one)
    - Exercise: pick a good idea for your team. A idea that **you** will be good executing it.

2. How big is the market
    - 2 times of markets that are good for startups:
        - Ones that are big now
        - Ones that are small but rapdly growing
        - e.g.: coinbase (small in the beggining but grown up)

3. How accute is the problem?
    - It is a problem, ok, but it is a problem that will make the people use your thing?
    - It is a problem, but people really care for it?
    - e.g.: Brex. It was a corporate credit card for startups. Before that, if a startup did want a coporate credit card, they litelly could not get one because not bank would give a credit card for a startup. **That** is a good problem. *If the alternative for your solution is litelly **nothing**, that's a good problem*.

4. Do you have competition?
    - Having a competition it is **not** bad.
        - Most good startup ideas have competition, but if you were going up agains especially entrenched competition you tipically need a new insight

5. Do *really* want your solution?
    - The people you know really want this?
    - If the answer is no, you have to talk to people

6. Did this recently become possible or necessary?
    - Something that recently changed in the world is often what creates a new oportunity
    - e.g.: checker -> a platform to do background checks (of employees) via api. Big companies that need to "hire" a lot of people or make a lot of checks (like uber, ifood) can make checks about the person. Before Checker, the job was made for a bunch of big large companies, but not well suited for this new case.

7. Are there good proxies for this business?
    - A large company that does something similar to your startup but is not a direct competidor
    - e.g.: Rappi -> there was a couple of other delivery companies in the US and another countries, so Rappi started in the LATAN. *If works there, maybe here we have a a market too*.

8. Is this an idea you'd want to work on for **years**?
    - This is a good sign, but often is not. Founders, good founders, usually become passionate for your ideas when things starts to work well. Like: doing taxes. Nobody likes it, but when you have a successful business in this area, maybe you will become passionate about.

9. Is this a scalable businees?
    - If it is software, just check this.

10. Is this a good *idea space*?
    - An idea space is like one level of abstraction out from a particular startup idea. A class of closely related startup ideas.
    - Software for hospitals, food delivers, etc. Your have an ideia of an app to manage hospitals, so your idea space is software for hospitals.
    - Pick a good idea space. It is something that will have a reasonably hit rate for a startup and one that has founder/market fit.
    - e.g.: Fivetran -> tool for data analysis but the companies didn't want it. They pivoted (browsing the idea space) and they did another tool for it. The companies didn't want that either. But each time they pivot and sell, they learn more about what these companies want. Eventually they found what was missing.
    - Be in a good idea space, allows you to bump into new startup ideas, using the old ones, knowing better you target.

# 3 things that makes your startup ideas seem bad, but actually is quite good

Ideas that, because of the constraints, helps the founders.

1. Hard to get started
    - Stripe
        - Really difficult at the time. All developers new that integrate credit card payments were a pain in the ass. But not one of them tried to start Stripe.
        - Getting started with it seems reeeally dificult: special deals with banks, learn about credit card infrastructure, other things. Everyone was scared of it.

2. Boring space
    - Gusto -> makes payroll software. Boring, nobody wanted to build something for it. They did.
    - These are ideas that stays in the table for a long time.
    - Fun ideas are fun, but... Well... Everyone wanna do it as well.
    - Don't fool yourself. Fun ideas are fun in the beggining, but the day-a-day work is just like any other idea.

3. Existing competidors
    - You can do benchmark, change just a little thing.
    - If you don't have competidors, you may find out that this happens because no one want that product.
    - If they suck or are missing something, you have your space to jump on.
    - Dropbox: all of the existing alternatives sucked. The UI, the UX (have to upload one file at a time in a website). Dropbox just synced the files with the OS.

# How to generate startup ideas?

Of course you can sitting down and thing, but the best way is just to have this organically.
Live.

1. Become an expert on something valuable
2. Work at a startup
3. Build things that you find interesting even if is not a business or a startup idea.
    - e.g.: replit. The founder just found it interesting and built it.

## 7 recipies to generate good startup ideas

Maybe not all of them are good for you.

1. Start with what your team is speacially good at
    - Automatic founder/market fit
    - e.g.: rezi -> rent apartments, they were expert in this field

2. Start with a problem you've personally encountered
    - Ideally one that you are in a unusually position to see
    - e.g.: Vetcove -> Amazon for vets. They noticed that order supplies were super old fashion.
    - A lot of programmers wasting time in tarpit ideas and a lot of vets with this problem.

> Using these first two
>   01 Think of every job you've had (+ internships + life experiences)
>       Think realy carefully about it.
>   02 What are problems or opportunities you've been in a special position to see?
>       What you know that other people maybe did not saw yet?

3. Think of things you personally wish existed
    - Classic
    - e.g.: doordash, ifood
    - It is kinda dangerous and can lead to tarpit ideas. Think with yourself: is there a reason why this did not exist yet?

4. Look for things in the world that have changed recently
    - Create a new oportunity with it
    - e.g.: covid

5. Look for new variantes of successful companies
